Chesapeake Bay Spatial Distribution Analysis 

#Abstract of study: 

Jellyfish blooms have significant impacts on the food web and physical state of a local shallow habitat. Understanding the rise and fall of jellyfish blooms requires information on the source stage (sessile polyp) of many pelagic scyphozoans. Results from a two-year in situ settlement study coupled with historical data and hydrographic conditions were analyzed to investigate planula recruitment and its role in defining the spatial range of Chrysaora chesapeakei polyps; a stinging nettle species found in Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, high-definition sonar-imagery data were collected to explore patterns of seasonality between polyps and medusae. Results show that the spatial distribution of C. quinnquecirrha polyps in Chesapeake Bay is a result of variable residence times, while the seasonality exhibited by densities of C. quinnquecirrha at different life stages is indicative of environmental cues that trigger reproduction, settlement on hard substrate, and survivability through harsh winter conditions. Findings of this study reveal portions of complexity embedded within the C. chesapeakei life cycle and its local shallow habitat and affirm the importance of studying gelatinous species within a species specific context. 

#Code 
Extract residence time data from rasterized and georeferenced images (Du and Shen 2016)
Select appropriate GLM for data (binary - presence/absence of polyps at 52 different sites)
Run model selection (error analysis and diagnostics) 
Predict spatial patterns of polyp probability
